        //
        // As far as I can see, the desired properties are:
        //  (a) We shouldn't read from the socket if the peer might have already returned their
        //      socket to the caller and started sending us real data. Otherwise we have to either.
        //      drop that data or return it in the PunchedUdpSocket struct.
        //  (b) We should only return the socket once there are no more hole-punch messages to
        //      receive. Otherwise the caller will start reading from the socket and find crap on the wire.
        //  (c) We should try to return as soon as possible after establishing a connection.
        //  (d) We should account for the fact that UDP is unreliable by resending messages.
        //
        // The problem is none of these requirements are possible to fulfill 100% of the time and
        // they all conflict with each other. So we need to decide how bad these problems are
        // relative to each other. In the case of (a) sending back data inside PunchedUdpSocket
        // wouldn't be the end of the world but it would be pretty annoying for the user as they'd
        // need to process that data and couldn't just start using their socket whereever it's
        // needed. Applications that use UDP should account for the fact that data can dissapear
        // anyway but it might be problematic for some apps if the very first chunk of data very
        // often dissapears. In the case of (b) applications need to account for the fact that
        // random data can sometimes appear on a UDP socket but they're probably not expecting to
        // get random data from the peer they're talking to. We should at the very least make sure
        // our hole punch packets are easily recognizable and give the user a facility to identify
        // them and throw them away. (c) is important but it conflicts with (b) and (d). In the
        // case of (d) it would helpful to have some idea of the probability of a given packet
        // being lost and balance that against (c).
        //
        // Assuming we successfully punch a hole there's four ways this can happen: (0) we get one
        // of their hole punching messages and it's from an address we were sending to. In this
        // case they likely got our hole punch message(s) aswell although it's possible the packet
        // got dropped. (1) We get one of their hole punching messages from an address that we
        // weren't sending to. In this case they haven't received any of our messages and we'll
        // definitely need to send an ack to their address. (2) We receive an ack to one of our
        // messages and it's from an address we weren't sending to. I don't think this should ever
        // happen. (3) We receive an ack to one of our packets and it's from an address we were
        // sending to. In this case they likely initially didn't have an address they could contact
        // us on.
        //
        // For now we keep the algorithm simple: If we get a hole punch message we send back two
        // acks with a delay in between before returning. If we get an ack we return immediately.
